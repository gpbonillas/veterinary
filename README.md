It's based on the module created by Bilal that can be found in the [Odoo Apps](https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/11.0/veterinary/) and modifications by  [@errorandtrial](https://github.com/errorandtrial) that you can see in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/errorandtrial/veterinary) .

The project contains different clinical tests:
